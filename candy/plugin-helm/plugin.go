// Package helm is the charly plugin serving the `step:helm-release` install step and
// the `verb:helm` check verb (the helm words, Factory Unit 1) — an importable root
// package + its own go.mod, host-built and served OUT-OF-PROCESS over go-plugin gRPC
// via the charly plugin SDK (github.com/opencharly/sdk), exactly like plugin-kube /
// plugin-wl. It owns NO Kubernetes client library: every operation shells out to the
// venue's `helm` binary over the host's live DeployExecutor reverse channel
// (sdk.ExecutorFromInvoke → RunCapture), so the plugin's go.mod carries no
// k8s.io/client-go dependency.
//
//   - step:helm-release — a plugin-contributed `external:helm-release` install-step KIND
//     (F3): its OPAQUE Payload is the #HelmReleaseStep def, carried through the InstallPlan
//     IR and validated against this plugin's served schema at authoring. The step performs
//     the `helm upgrade --install` invocation IN-VENUE (against the venue's kubeconfig —
//     /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml on a k3s guest) and returns a teardown ReverseOp
//     (`helm uninstall`) the host records + replays (record-and-replay). StepContract:
//     Scope system, Venue host-native (0), no gate, Emits=false — a DEPLOY-only step
//     (helm installs happen at deploy, never at image build).
//   - verb:helm — the declarative release-status assertion (the `verb:kube` analog): its
//     method + method-exclusive modifiers ride the desugared plugin input, validated
//     against #HelmInput. EXEC-based (like wl/dbus): the host attaches its live
//     DeployExecutor over the E3b reverse channel and this plugin RunCaptures the venue's
//     helm binary; a missing broker is a HARD FAIL.
